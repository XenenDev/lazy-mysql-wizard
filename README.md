# lazy-mysql-wizard

A modern Python Tkinter application for effortless MySQL database management, powered by GPT-4.1 AI integration. 

## Features
- **AI MySQL Assistant**: Ask an AI expert to generate, review, and run SQL queries for you. The AI is context-aware of your database schema and can chain together complex operations, only asking for confirmation when needed.
- **Modern GUI**: Clean, flat, and responsive interface with dark mode, section borders, and a results table.
- **SQL Editor & History**: Edit, review, and run SQL queries. Browse your query history with up/down arrows.
- **Results Viewer**: View, select, and copy table results. Highlight and preview cell values.
- **AI Chat**: Natural language chat with the AI, which can plan, reason, and execute database operations on your behalf.
- **Safety**: The AI will only ask for confirmation before running data-changing queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). SELECT queries and safe operations are run automatically.
- **Customizable**: Edit queries before running, and view all AI-generated SQL before execution.
- **No API Key Required**: AI features are optional; you can use the app as a lightweight DB viewer without OpenAI integration.
